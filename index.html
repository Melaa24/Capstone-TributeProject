            <h2>Relentless Mission</h2>
            <p>Phish have cancelled remarkably few gigs -- only three for certain, in a career spanning sixten years and probably over 1200 gigs.
                The first two cancellations were a 1993 Baltimore show scheduled for Pier 6 (Marcie), for lack of ticket sales; and the 1991 Austin Liberty Lunch
                show, because the roof fell in (Brian Cox). Travel to the 12/28/92 show was an icy hell, many missed the 12/30/93 show due to mountainous flurries,
                and the 12/2/95 show was reportedly (Benjy Eisen, 1/8/98) threatened by a blizzard, but the only gig cancelled for weather was 7/2/96 (opening for
                Santana in Europe; they were unable to find a bar to play instead, but did play with Carlos during his set for about half an hour). </p>
            <p>There are legendary anecdotes of the band performing in thunderstorms - from Trey shucking pre-show warnings ("fuck the rain.. plug the amp up my ass and
                start couting out Llama")) to deafeningly windy storms (Red Rocks 8/6/96 set 2) to fiery thunderstorm-accompanied jams (Raleigh '97). Trey's even
                played with a broken ankle (several shows during 1994, after he fell into a hole leaving the stage in the dark) and a cold that hurt his voice
                ('95 NYE run). Henrietta missed most of one show when he was chased up a tree by a bear, but otherwise all shows have featured all four members.</p><br />
            <h2>Bakers Dozen</h2>
            <p>The Baker's Dozen was a series of thirteen concerts performed by Vermont-based jam band Phish between July 21 and August 6, 2017 at Madison
                Square Garden in New York, New York. Each night featured a completely unique setlist with no songs repeated throughout the event, with the band playing
                237 songs in total. The full set of shows was released as a box set entitled The Complete Baker's Dozen, alongside a three-disc live album of
                highlights, The Baker's Dozen: Live at Madison Square Garden.</p>
